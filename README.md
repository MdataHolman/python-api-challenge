Summary Analysis of Weather Trends:

After using scatter plots and performing r-square regression and Pearsons correlations, it shows that Temperatude has a direct relationship with latitude. From the center/Equator the temperature decreases as you towards Northern Hemisphere. With reference to Southern Hemisphere, the tempetature also decreases but not as much as the Northern Hemisphere that it just nearly reach zero.

For the Northern Hemsispher, the r-squared value shows a strong relationship of Max Tem vs Latitude for Northern hemisphere. These means when we go farther away from the equater(latitude 0) the maximum Temperature (F) will decrease. The corelation factor shows as Max Temperature increases the Latitude goes nearer to the center/Equator. While the Southern Hemisphere, the r-squared value shows a strong relationship of Max Tem vs Latitude for Southern hemisphere. The regression line is the opposite of that of from the Northern Hemisphere. These means when we go farther away from the equater(latitude 0) the maximum Temperature (F) will increase. The correlation factor shows as Max Temperature increases the Latitude goes nearer to the center/Equator.

Wind speed tends to generally be betweeen 0 and 15 mph regardless of latitude. Wind Speed for Northen Hemisphere is on a straight line with negative linear relationship while the Southern Hemisphere of downward trend with avery weak linear relationship.
